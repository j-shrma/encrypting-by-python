The old lighthouse stood sentinel on the rocky cliff, its weathered stones bearing witness to a century of storms and sunlit mornings. every evening at dusk, the keeper would climb the spiral staircase, his footsteps echoing against the curved walls, to light the beacon that guided ships safely home. the beam swept across the darkened waters in rhythmic intervals, a silent conversation between land and sea. local fishermen said the light had saved countless lives over the years, though the keeper himself rarely spoke of such things. he simply did his duty, tending the flame that pushed back the night, while seabirds wheeled and cried in the salt-laden air above.
