  JAI'S ENCRYPTION SYSTEM - USER GUIDE
===============================================

WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?
---------------------
This is a text encryption/decryption tool that converts letters and symbols
into numerical codes using a custom encryption algorithm.


HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:
-----------------------

1. RUN THE PROGRAM:
   - Double-click encryption.exe (or run: python encryption.py)

2. CHOOSE AN OPTION FROM THE MENU:
   
   Option 1 - Encrypt Message:
   ---------------------------
   - Type your message directly
   - Get encrypted numbers instantly
   - Example: "HELLO" → "3251232353"

   Option 2 - Encrypt from a file:
   --------------------------------
   - Prepare a .txt file with your message
   - Enter the file path when asked
   - A new file will be created: filename_encrypted.txt
   - Example: If you encrypt "message.txt", you get "message_encrypted.txt"

   Option 3 - Decrypt Message:
   ---------------------------
   - Enter encrypted numbers
   - Get the original message back
   - Example: "3251232353" → "Hello"

   Option 4 - Decrypt to a file:
   -----------------------------
   - Have an encrypted .txt file ready
   - Enter the file path when asked
   - A new file will be created: filename_decrypted.txt
   - Example: "message_encrypted.txt" → "message_decrypted.txt"

   Option 5 - Exit:
   ----------------
   - Closes the program


FILE PATH EXAMPLES:
-------------------
✅ Full path: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\myfile.txt
✅ Same folder: myfile.txt (if file is in same folder as .exe)
✅ Relative path: ..\Documents\myfile.txt

❌ Invalid: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\myfile (missing .txt extension)


SUPPORTED CHARACTERS:
---------------------
✅ Letters: A-Z (case insensitive)
✅ Space
✅ Symbols: . ! @ # $ % , ? + - * /

❌ Numbers are NOT supported in the message (will cause an error)


EXAMPlE USAGE:
--------------
1. Create a file called "secret.txt" with text: "HELLO WORLD"
2. Run the program
3. Select option 2
4. Enter: secret.txt
5. Result: "secret_encrypted.txt" will be created with: "32512323530025534224234441"
6. To decrypt, select option 4 and enter: secret_encrypted.txt
7. Result: "secret_decrypted.txt" will contain: "Hello world"


TIPS:
-----
• Always keep a backup of your original files
• Encrypted files contain only numbers
• Decrypted text will be in sentence case (first letter capitalized)
• Make sure file paths are correct (check spelling and location)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Error: "Only letters are allowed"
→ Your message contains unsupported characters (like numbers)

Error: "Invalid file path"
→ File doesn't exist or path is wrong. Check the location.

Error: "Encrypted text must have an even number of digits"
→ The encrypted code is corrupted or incomplete

Error: "Invalid encrypted code"
→ The numbers don't match any valid encryption code


NEED HELP?
----------
Make sure:
1. Your text files are saved in .txt format
2. File paths are correct
3. You're using only supported characters
4. The .exe and your text files are accessible
